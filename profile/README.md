## üî≠ High Energy Astrophysics group ü™ê

The High Energy Astrophysics group (check out our [website](https://hea.physics.muni.cz/)) is a research group at the Department of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. 
We are an international research group, led by Prof. [Norbert Werner](https://hea.physics.muni.cz/people/norbert.html), focusing on the hot and energetic Universe over multiple wavelengths and physical scales. 
We bridge observational, theoretical, and computational fields across a wide range of disciplines.

The methods and tools listed below have been developed by members of the group and made available to the community. Each repository contains a description of how to use these tools and how to eventually cite them.
